In a group project focused on converting American Sign Language (ASL) to words using computer vision and machine learning, we captured and processed a custom dataset of hand gestures. We then implemented a real-time ASL letter prediction system using OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking, combined with a Random Forest classifier for accurate gesture recognition. The project successfully translated ASL gestures into corresponding letters, demonstrating a practical application of machine learning in assistive technology.
